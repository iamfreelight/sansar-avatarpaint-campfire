# sansar-avatarpaint-campfire
"AvatarPaint Campfire" version, is a demo that makes the avatars in the scene turn the 'normal tint' when near the scene's campfire's 'WarmAreaTrigger', but when they leave it they turn 'ColdColor' (cyan/blue works good).. when they enter the 'BurnAreaTrigger' it makes the avatar look burnt and plays a (sizzle) sound
